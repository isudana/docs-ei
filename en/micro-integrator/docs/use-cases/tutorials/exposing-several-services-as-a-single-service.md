# Service Orchestration

## What you'll build

When information from several services are required to construct a response to a client request, service chaining needs to be implemented. That is, several services are integrated based on some business logic and exposed as a single, aggregated service. 

In this use tutorial, when a client sends a request for a medical appointment, the Micro Integrator performs several service call to multiple back-end services in order to construct the response that includes all the necessary details. 

To build this mediation flow, you will update the API resource from the [previous tutorial](transforming-message-content.md) to send messages through the Micro Integrator to the back-end service using the **Call** mediator instead of the **Send** mediator. Using the Call mediator allows you to specify all service invocations one after the other within a single sequence. You will then use the **PayloadFactory** mediator to take the response from one back-end service and change it to the format that is accepted by the other back-end service.

## Let's get started!

### Step 1: Set up the workspace

To set up the tools:

-   Download the relevant [WSO2 Integration Studio](https://wso2.com/integration/tooling/) based on your operating system. The path to the extracted/installed folder is referred to as `MI_TOOLING_HOME` throughout this tutorial.
-  Download the [CLI Tool](https://wso2.com/integration/micro-integrator/install/) for monitoring artifact deployments.

If you did not try the [Transforming Message Content](transforming-message-content.md) tutorial yet, open WSO2 Integration Studio, click **File** , and then click **Import**. Next, select **Existing WSO2 Projects into workspace** under the **WSO2** category, click **Next** and upload the [pre-packaged project](https://github.com/wso2-docs/WSO2_EI/blob/master/Integration-Tutorial-Artifacts/TransformingContentTutorial.zip). 


### Step 2: Develop the integration artifacts

#### Create new Endpoints

Let's create new HTTP endpoints to represent the back-end services that are required for checking the channelling fee and to settle the payment.

1.  Right click **SampleServices** in the Project Explorer and navigate to **New -> Endpoint**. 
2.  Ensure **Create a New Endpoint** is selected and click **Next.**
3.  Enter the details given below:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Endpoint Name</td>
            <td>ChannelingFeeEP</td>
            <td>The name of the endpoint.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Endpoint Type</td>
            <td>
               <code>HTTP Endpoint</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                Indicates that the back-end service is HTTP.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>URI Template</td>
            <td>
                <code>http://localhost:9090/{uri.var.hospital}/categories/appointments/{uri.var.appointment_id}/fee</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                The template for the request URL expected by the back-end service.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Method</td>
            <td>
                <code>GET</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                This endpoint artifact will be used to get information from the back-end service.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>Static Endpoint</td>
         <td><br/>
         </td>
         <td>Select this option because we are going to use this endpoint only in this ESB Config project and will not reuse it in other projects.</br/></br/> <b>Note</b>: If you need to create a reusable endpoint, save it as a Dynamic Endpoint in either the Configuration or Governance Registry.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Save Endpoint in</td>
         <td><code>               SampleServices              </code></td>
         <td>This is the ESB Config project we created in the last section</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

4.  Click **Finish**.

5.  Create another endpoint for the Settle Payment back-end service and specify the details given below:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Endpoint Name</td>
            <td>SettlePaymentEP </td>
            <td>The name of the endpoint.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Endpoint Type</td>
            <td>
               <code>HTTP Endpoint</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                Indicates that the back-end service is HTTP.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>URI Template</td>
            <td>
                <code>http://localhost:9090/healthcare/payments</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                The template for the request URL expected by the back-end service.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Method</td>
            <td>
                <code>POST </code>
            </td>
            <td>
                This endpoint artifact will be used to post inforamtion to the back-end service.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>Static Endpoint</td>
         <td><br/>
         </td>
         <td>Select this option because we are going to use this endpoint only in this ESB Config project and will not reuse it in other projects.</br/></br/> <b>Note</b>: If you need to create a reusable endpoint, save it as a Dynamic Endpoint in either the Configuration or Governance Registry.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Save Endpoint in</td>
         <td><code>SampleServices</code></td>
         <td>This is the ESB Config project we created in the last section</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

6.  Click **Finish**.

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132239.png)

You have now created the additional endpoints that are required for this tutorial.

#### Update the mediation flow

You can now start updating the API resource with the mediation flow.

1.  Add a new **Property** mediator just after the **Get Hospital** Property mediator in the In Sequence of the API resource to retrieve and store the card number that is sent in the request payload.

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132238.png?effects=drop-shadow)  

2.  With the Property mediator selected, access the Properties tab and specify the following details:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Property Name</td>
         <td>Enter <code>               New Property...              </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>New Property Name</td>
         <td>Enter <code>card_number             </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Property Action</td>
         <td>Enter <code>               set              </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Value Type</td>
         <td>Enter <code>               EXPRESSION              </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Value Expression</td>
         <td>
            <code>json-eval($.cardNo)</code>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Description</td>
          <td>Get Card Number</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

3.  Go to the first case box of the Switch mediator. Add a Property mediator just after the Log mediator to store the value for `          uri.var.hospital         ` variable that will be used when sending requests to **ChannelingFeeEP** service. 

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132237.png)

4.  With the Property mediator selected, access the Properties tab and specify the following details:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Property Name</td>
         <td>Enter <code>               New Property...              </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>New Property Name</td>
         <td>Enter <code>uri.var.hospital </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Property Action</td>
         <td>Enter <code>               set              </code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Value Type</td>
         <td>Enter <code>LITERAL</code>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Property Data Type</td>
          <td>STRING</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Value</td>
         <td>
            <code>grandoaks</code>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Description</td>
          <td>Set Hospital Variable</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

5.  Similarly, add property mediators in the other two case boxes in the Switch mediator. Change only the **Value** field as follows:
    -   Case 2: `            clemency           `
    -   Case 3: `            pinevalley           `  

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132236.png)

6.  Delete the Send mediator by right clicking on the mediator and selecting **Delete from Model**. Replace this with a Call mediator from the **Mediators** palette and add GrandOakEP from the **Defined Endpoints** palette to the empty box adjoining the Call mediator.  
      
7.  Replace the Send mediators in the following two case boxes as well and add ClemencyEP and PineValleyEP to the respective boxesadjoining the Call mediators.  
    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132235.png)

    !!! Info
        Replacing with a Call mediator allows us to define other service invocations following this mediator.
    
    Let's use Property mediators to retrieve and store the values that you get from the response you receive from GrandOakEP, ClemencyEP, or PineValleyEP.

8.  Next to the Switch mediator, add a Property mediator to retrieve and store the value sent as `           appointmentNumber          ` .

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132234.png) 

9.  With the Property mediator selected, access the Properties tab and specify the following details:

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Property Name</td>
    <td>Select <strong>New Property</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>New Property Name</td>
    <td>Enter <code>               uri.var.appointment_id              </code>.<br />
    This value is used when invoking <b>ChannelingFeeEP</b>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Property Action</td>
    <td><p>Select <strong>set</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Value Type</td>
    <td>Select <strong>EXPRESSION</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Value Expression</td>
    <td><code>               json-eval($.appointmentNumber)              </code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Description</td>
    <td>Get Appointment Number</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    !!! Note
        You derive the **Value Expression** in the above table from the following response that is received from GrandOakEP, ClemencyEP, or PineValleyEP:
        ```json
        {"appointmentNumber":1,   "doctor":
            {"name":"thomas collins",
                     "hospital":"grand oak community hospital",
                     "category":"surgery","availability":"9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m",
                     "fee":7000.0},
               "patient":
                   {"name":"John Doe",
                    "dob":"1990-03-19",
                    "ssn":"234-23-525",
                    "address":"California",
                    "phone":"8770586755",
                    "email":"johndoe@gmail.com"},
               "fee":7000.0,
               "confirmed":false}
        ```

10.  Similarly, add two more Property mediators. They retrieve and store the `           doctor          ` details and `           patient          ` details respectively from the response that is received from GrandOakEP, ClemencyEP, or PineValleyEP.

      - To store `doctor` details:

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Property</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Property Name</td>
              <td>
                  Select <strong>New Property</strong>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>New Property Name</td>
              <td>
                 Enter <code>doctor_details</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Property Action</td>
              <td>
                Select <strong>set</strong>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Value Type</td>
              <td>
                Select <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Value Expression</td>
              <td>
                Enter <code>json-eval($.doctor)</code>.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Description</td>
              <td>
                 Get Doctor Details
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

      - To store `patient` details:

          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Property</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Property Name</td>
              <td>Select <strong>New Property</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>New Property Name</td>
              <td>
                Enter <code>patient_details</code>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Property Action</td>
              <td>
                Select <strong>set</strong>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Value Type</td>
              <td>
                Select <strong>EXPRESSION</strong>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Value Expression</td>
              <td>
                Enter <code>json-eval($.patient)</code>

            </tr>
          </table>

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132233.png)

11.  Add a Call mediator and add ChannelingFeeEP from **Defined Endpoints** palette to the empty box adjoining the Call mediator.
12.  Add a Property mediator adjoining the Call mediator box to retrieve and store the value sent as `           actualFee          `. 
13.  Access the Property tab of the mediator and specify the following details:

    | Property            | Description                                                                                                                                    |

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132228/119132232.png)

    !!! Note
        You derive the Value Expression in the above table from the following response that is received from ChannelingFeeEP:
        ```
        {"patientName":" John Doe ", 
        "doctorName":"thomas collins", 
        "actualFee":"7000.0"}
        ```     

14. Let's use the **PayloadFactory** mediator to construct the following message payload for the request sent to SettlePaymentEP.

    ```json
    {"appointmentNumber":2,
            "doctor":{
                "name":"thomas collins",
                "hospital":"grand oak community hospital",
                "category":"surgery",
                "availability":"9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m",
                "Fee":7000.0
            },
            "patient":{
                "name":"John Doe",
                "Dob":"1990-03-19",
                "ssn":"234-23-525",
                "address":"California",
                "phone":"8770586755",
                "email":"johndoe@gmail.com"
            },
            "fee":7000.0,
            "Confirmed":false,
            "card_number":"1234567890"
    }
    ```

15.  Add a PayloadFactory mediator next to the Property mediator, from the **mediators** palette to construct the above message payload.

16. With the Payloadfactory mediator selected, access the properties tab of the mediator and specify the following details:

    | Property       |Descripttion                                                                                            |
    |----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Payload Format | Select <strong>Inline</strong>                                                                         |
    | Media Type     | Select <strong>json</strong>                                                                           |
    | Payload        | `{"appointmentNumber":$1, "doctor":$2, "patient":$3, "fee":$4, "confirmed":"false", "card_number":"$5"}`</br></br> This is the message payload to send with the request to SettlePaymentEP. In this payload, $1, $2, $3, $4, and $5 indicate variables. |
    
17. To add the **Args** field for the PayloadFactory mediator, click the **Add (+)** icon in the **Args** field and enter the following information as in the table below. It provides the argument that defines the actual value of the first variable used in the format definition in the previous step.

    !!! Tip
        To avoid getting an error message, first select the **Media Type** before providing the **Payload.**

    | Field         | Description                                                  | Description                                                          |
    |---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Type**      | Expression                                                   | -                                                                    |
    | **Value**     | `$ctx:uri.var.appointment_id `                               | The value for the first variable ($1) in the message payload format. |
    | **Evaluator** | xml                                                          | Indicates that the expression provided is in XML.                    |

    !!! Info
        The `           $ctx          ` method is similar to using the `           get-property          ` method. This method checks in the message context.
    
18. Similarly, click **Add** and add more arguments to define the other variables that are used in the message payload format definition. Use the following as the **Value** for each of them:

    -   `$ctx:doctor_details`  
    -   `           $ctx:patient_details          `  
    -   `           $ctx:actual_fee          `  
    -   `           $ctx:card_number          `

19. Add a Call mediator and add SettlePaymentEP from Defined Endpoints palette to the empty box adjoining the Call mediator.
20. Add a **Respond** mediator to send the response to the client. 

You should now have a completed configuration that looks like this:

### Step 3: Package the artifacts

Package the artifacts in your composite application project (SampleServicesCompositeApplication project) and the registry resource project (SampleRegistryResource project) to be able to deploy the artifacts in the server.

1.  Open the `          pom.xml         ` file in the composite application project POM editor.
2.  Ensure that the following projects and artifacts are selected in the POM file.

    -   SampleServicesCompositeApplicationProject
        -   `HealthcareAPI`
        -   `ClemencyEP`
        -   `GrandOakEP`
        -   `PineValleyEP`
        -   `ChannelingFeeEP`
        -   `SettlePaymentEP`
    -   SampleServicesRegistryProject

3.  Save the project.

### Step 4: Build and run the artifacts

To test the artifacts, deploy the [packaged artifacts](#step-3-package-the-artifacts) in the embedded Micro Integrator:

1.  Right-click the composite application project and click **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.
2.  In the dialog that opens, select the composite application project that you want to deploy.  
3.  Click **Finish**. The artifacts will be deployed in the embedded Micro Integrator and the server will start. See the startup log in the **Console** tab. 

### Step 5: Test the use case

Let's test the use case by sending a simple client request that invokes the service.

#### Start the back-end service

1. Download the JAR file of the back-end service from [here](https://github.com/wso2-docs/WSO2_EI/blob/master/Back-End-Service/Hospital-Service-2.0.0-EI7.jar).
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the location where your saved the [back-end service](#step-1-set-up-the-workspace).
3. Execute the following command to start the service:

    ```bash
    java -jar Hospital-Service-2.0.0-EI7.jar
    ```

#### Send the client request

Let's use the **CLI Tool** to find the URL of the REST API that is deployed in the Micro Integrator:

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `CLI_HOME/bin` directory.
2.  Execute the following command to start the tool:
    `./mi`
3.  Execute the following command to find the APIs deployed in the server:
    `mi api show`

Let's send a request to the API resource.

1.  Create a JSON file named `           request.json          ` with the following request payload.

    ```json
    {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "dob": "1940-03-19",
     "ssn": "234-23-525",
     "address": "California",
     "phone": "8770586755",
     "email": "johndoe@gmail.com",
     "doctor": "thomas collins",
     "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
     "cardNo": "7844481124110331",
     "appointment_date": "2025-04-02"
    }
    ```

2.  Open a command line terminal and execute the following command from the location where the `           request.json          ` file is
    saved:

    ```bash
    curl -v -X POST --data @request.json  http://localhost:8290/healthcare/categories/surgery/reserve  --header "Content-Type:application/json"
    ```

    !!! Info
        This is derived from the **URI-Template** defined when creating the API resource: `http://<host>:<port>/categories/{category}/reserve`
    
#### Analyze the response

You will see the response as follows:

```json
{  
"appointmentNo":1,
"doctorName":"thomas collins",
"patient":"John Doe",
"actualFee":7000.0,
"discount":20,
"discounted":5600.0,
"paymentID":"480fead2-e592-4791-941a-690ad1363802",
"status":"Settled"
}
```

You have now explored how the Micro Integrator can do service chaining using the Call mediator and transform message payloads from one format to another using the **PayloadFactory** mediator.
