# Switching from HTTP to FIX

This example demonstrates how WSO2 Micro Integrator receives messages in HTTP and forwards them through FIX.

Synapse will create a session with Executor and forward the order request. The first response coming from the Executor will be sent back over HTTP. Executor generally sends two responses for each incoming order request. But since the response has to be forwarded over HTTP, only one can be sent back to the client.

## Synapse configuration

Following are the integration artifacts (proxy service) that we can used to implement this scenario.

```xml
<proxy name="FIXProxy">
    <parameter name="transport.fix.InitiatorConfigURL">file:/home/synapse_user/fix-config/synapse-sender.cfg</parameter>
    <parameter name="transport.fix.InitiatorMessageStore">file</parameter>
    <parameter name="transport.fix.SendAllToInSequence">false</parameter>
    <parameter name="transport.fix.DropExtraResponses">true</parameter>
    <target>
        <endpoint>
            <address uri="fix://localhost:19876?BeginString=FIX.4.0&SenderCompID=SYNAPSE&TargetCompID=EXEC"/>
        </endpoint>
        <inSequence>
            <property name="transport.fix.ServiceName" value="FIXProxy" scope="axis2-client"/>
            <log level="full"/>
        </inSequence>
        <outSequence>
            <log level="full"/>
            <send/>
        </outSequence>
    </target>
</proxy>
```

## Configuring Sample FIX Applications

If you are using a binary distribution of Quickfix/J, the two samples
and their configuration files are all packed to a single JAR file called
`         quickfixj-examples.jar        ` . You will have to extract the
JAR file, modify the configuration files and pack them to a JAR file
again under the same name.

You can pass the new configuration file as a command line parameter too,
in that case you do not need to modify the
`         quickfixj-examples.jar        ` . You can copy the config
files from `         $ESB_HOME/repository/samples/resources/fix        `
folder to `         $QFJ_HOME/etc folder        ` . Execute the sample
apps from `         $QFJ_HOME/bin        ` ,
`         ./banzai.sh/bat ../etc/banzai.cfg executor.sh/bat ../etc/executor.cfg        `
.

Locate and edit the FIX configuration file of Executor to be as follows.
This file is usually named `         executor.cfg        ` .

```java
[default]
    FileStorePath=examples/target/data/executor
    ConnectionType=acceptor
    StartTime=00:00:00
    EndTime=00:00:00
    HeartBtInt=30
    ValidOrderTypes=1,2,F
    SenderCompID=EXEC
    TargetCompID=SYNAPSE
    UseDataDictionary=Y
    DefaultMarketPrice=12.30

    [session]
    BeginString=FIX.4.0
    SocketAcceptPort=19876
```

Locate and edit the FIX configuration file of Banzai to be as follows.
This file is usually named `         banzai.cfg        ` .

```java
[default]
    FileStorePath=examples/target/data/banzai
    ConnectionType=initiator
    SenderCompID=BANZAI
    TargetCompID=SYNAPSE
    SocketConnectHost=localhost
    StartTime=00:00:00
    EndTime=00:00:00
    HeartBtInt=30
    ReconnectInterval=5

    [session]
    BeginString=FIX.4.0
    SocketConnectPort=9876
```

The `         FileStorePath        ` property in the above two files
should point to two directories in your local file system. The launcher
scripts for the sample application can be found in the bin directory of
Quickfix/J distribution.

## Configuring Micro Integrator for FIX Samples

In order to configure WSO2 Micro Integrator to run the FIX samples given above, you will need to create some FIX configuration files as specified below (you can find the config files from `$ESB_HOME/repository/samples/resources/fix folder`).

The `FileStorePath` property in the following two files should point to two directories in your local file system. Once the
samples are executed, Synapse will create FIX message stores in these
two directories.

Put the following entries in a file called `fix-synapse.cfg`.

```java
[default]
FileStorePath=repository/logs/fix/data
ConnectionType=acceptor
StartTime=00:00:00
EndTime=00:00:00
HeartBtInt=30
ValidOrderTypes=1,2,F
SenderCompID=SYNAPSE
TargetCompID=BANZAI
UseDataDictionary=Y
DefaultMarketPrice=12.30

[session]
BeginString=FIX.4.0
SocketAcceptPort=9876
```

Put the following entries in a file called
`synapse-sender.cfg`.

```java
[default]
FileStorePath=repository/logs/fix/data
SocketConnectHost=localhost
StartTime=00:00:00
EndTime=00:00:00
HeartBtInt=30
ReconnectInterval=5
SenderCompID=SYNAPSE
TargetCompID=EXEC
ConnectionType=initiator

[session]
BeginString=FIX.4.0
SocketConnectPort=19876
```
