# Quick Start Guide

Let's get started with WSO2 Micro Integrator by running a simple use case in your local environment. This is a simple service orchestration scenario. The scenario is about a basic health care system where Micro Integrator is used to integrate two backend hospital services to provide information to the client.

Most healthcare centers have a system that is used to make doctor appointments. To check the availability of the doctors for a particular time, users need to visit the hospitals or use each and every online system that is dedicated for a particular healthcare center. Here we are making it easier for patients by orchestrating those isolated systems for each healthcare provider and exposing a single interface to the users.

![Scenario](../../assets/img/quick-start-guide/MI-quick-start-guide.png)

In the above scenario, the following takes place:

1. The client makes a call to the Healthcare API created using Micro Integrator.

2. The Healthcare API calls the Pine Valley Hospital backend service and gets the queried information.

3. The Healthcare API calls the Grand Oak Hospital backend service and gets the queried information.

4. The response is returned to the client with the required information.

Both Grand Oak Hospital and Pine Valley Hospital have services exposed over HTTP protocol.

Pine Valley Hospital service accepts a GET request in following service endpoint URL.

```bash
http://<HOST_NAME>:<PORT>/pineValley/doctors
```

Grand Oak Hospital service accepts a GET request in following service endpoint URL.

```bash
http://<HOST_NAME>:<PORT>/grandOak/doctors/<DOCTOR_TYPE>
```

The expected payload should be in the following JSON format.

```bash
{
        "doctorType": "<DOCTOR_TYPE>"
}
```

Letâ€™s implement a simple integration solution that can be used to query for availability of doctors for a particular category from all the available healthcare centers.

## Before you begin

1. [Download Micro Integrator](https://www.wso2.com/integration/micro-integrator) for your Operating System. For more information, see [the Installation section](../../setup/installation/install_in_vm/).
   
2. Download the sample files from [here](https://github.com/wso2/docs-ei/blob/7.0.0/en/micro-integrator/docs/assets/attach/quick-start-guide/MI_QSG_HOME.zip). From this point onwards, let's refer to this folder as `<MI_QSG_HOME>`.

3. Download [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or a similar tool that can call an endpoint.

## Set up the workspace

To set up the integration workspace for this quick start guide, we will use an integration project that was built using WSO2 Integration Studio:

Go to the `<MI_QSG_HOME>` directory. The following project files and executable backend services files are available.

- **HealthcareConfigProject**: This is the ESB Config Project folder with the integration artifacts for the Healthcare service. This service consists of the following REST API:

  <details>
            <summary>HealthcareAPI.xml</summary>
	    ```xml

                 </resource>
            </api>
	    ```    
  </details>
  > **Note**: Here endpoints are defined inline in the API configuration for better clarity in reading the configuration. However, the best practice is to define them as named endpoint configurations so that they can be externalized to an environment specific entity.

- **HealthcareConfigProjectCompositeApplication**: This is the Composite Application Project folder, which contains the packaged CAR file of the Healthcare service.

- **BackendService**: This contains a executable .jar file that contains mock backend service implementation for Pine Valley Hospital and Grand Oak Hospital.

## Running the integration artifacts

Follow the steps given below to run the integration artifacts we developed on a Micro Integrator instance that is installed on a VM.

#### Start backend mock services

Two mock hospital information services are available in the `DoctorInfo.jar` file located at `<MI_QSG_HOME>/BackendService/` directory. 

Open a terminal window and use the following command to start the services.

```java
java -jar DoctorInfo.jar
```

You will see following get printed in the terminal

```bash
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9090
[ballerina/http] started HTTP/WS listener 0.0.0.0:9091
```

#### Deploy the Healthcare service

Copy the CAR file of the Healthcare service (HealthcareConfigProjectCompositeApplication_1.0.0.car), from the `<MI_QSG_HOME>/HealthcareConfigProjectCompositeApplication/target/` directory to the `<MI_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/carbonapps` directory.

#### Start the Micro Integrator

Follow the steps relevant to your OS:

On MacOS/Linux/CentOS, open a terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
sudo wso2mi-service start
```

On Windows, go to Start Menu -> Programs -> WSO2 -> Micro Integrator. This will open a terminal and start the relevant profile.

#### Invoke the Healthcare service

Open a terminal and execute the following curl command to invoke the service:

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8290/healthcare/doctor/Ophthalmologist
```

Upon invocation, you should be able to observe the following response:

```bash
[
    [
        {
            "name": "Geln Ivan",
            "time": "05:30 PM",
            "hospital": "pineValley"
        },
        {
            "name": "Daniel Lewis",
            "time": "05:30 PM",
            "hospital": "pineValley"
        }
    ],
    [
        {
            "name": "Shane Martin",
            "time": "07:30 AM",
            "hospital": "Grand Oak"
        },
        {
            "name": "Geln Ivan",
            "time": "08:30 AM",
            "hospital": "Grand Oak"
        }
    ]
]
```
