# About this Release (EI 7.0.0)

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) 7.0.0 is the only open-source, API-centric, and cloud-native integration platform to connect APIs, data, streams, SaaS, and legacy apps using microservices or ESB style architecture.  

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 7.0.0 consists of three integrators providing a comprehensive set of functionalities and features required to fulfill any enterprise-grade integration requirement. WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 7.0.0 also offers sophisticated tooling for each integrator providing a rich developer experience. Following are the key features of each runtime and tooling.

## Ballerina Integrator 1.0.0

WSO2 EI 7.0 is also the first solution to use Ballerina, a revolutionary new code-driven language for programming network-distributed applications. This is based on Ballerina 1.0.1, which consists of improvements to the language syntax and semantics based on the stable language specification version 2019R3

### What’s new in Ballerina Integrator?

-   Connectors for protocols like HTTP, File, FTP, Samba, gRPC, NATS and Kafka.
-   EI Connectors for well known SaaS applications like Salesforce, Amazon SQS, Amazon S3, Google Sheets and Gmail. You can pull them from Ballerina Central.
-   Improved support for EIP’s (Enterprise Integration Patterns) with tailor-made EI connectors and template support for tooling.
-   Java interoperability (allows you to call Java code from Ballerina)
-   Project Templates for widely used integration use cases. With this, we expect to save time spent on bootstrapping a new integration project. You can pull them from Ballerina Central.
