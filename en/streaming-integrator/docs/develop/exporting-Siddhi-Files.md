# Exporting Siddhi Applications

The Streaming Integrator Tooling allows you to export one or more Siddhi files as a Docker or Kubernetes artifact in order to run those Siddhi applications within a Docker or Kubernetes environment.

To export Siddhi files as Docker or Kubernetes artifacts, follow the steps given below.

## Exporting Siddhi applications as a Docker Image

To export one or more Siddhi applications as a Docker image, follow the procedure below:

1. Start the Streaming Integrator Tooling by issuing one of the following commands from the `<SI_HOME>/bin` directory.

    - For Windows: `tooling.bat`

    - For Linux: `./tooling.sh`

    The Streaming Integrator Tooling opens as shown below.

2. Create the required Siddhi files. The rest of the documentation assumes that you have one or more Siddhi applications to be exported as a Docker image. For more information, see [Creating a Siddhi Application](creating-a-Siddhi-Application.md).

3. Click **Export** menu option and then click **For Docker**.

    As a result, the following wizard opens.

4. In **Step 1: Select Siddhi Apps**, select one or more Siddhi applications to be included in the Docker image.

5. Click **Next**.

6. In **Step 2: Template Siddhi Apps**, template the Siddhi application if required. You can define a template within the Siddhi application via the `${...}` pattern. In the following example,  `${http.port}`) is added as a template within the source configuration.

    ```
    @source(type='http', receiver.url='http://localhost:${http.port}/${http.context}',
        @map(type = 'json'))
    define stream StockQuoteStream(symbol string, price double, volume int);
    ```

7. Once the templates are defined, click **Next**.

8. In **Step 3: Update Streaming Integrator configurations**, update the `deployment.yaml` file of the Streaming Integrator to enter configurations specific for the Docker image. Similar to the previous step, you can template the configurations as well. Use the similar notation (i.e., `${...}`) to specify a template within the configuration file.

9. Once the configuration is complete, click **Next**.

10. In **Step 4: Populate arguments template**, define values for the template fields defined in **Step 2** and **Step 3**. This step lists down all the template fields. Therefore you can set the relevant value for each field.

11. Once the template values are set, click **Next**.

12. In **Step 5: Bundle additional dependencies**, select the additional JARs to be shipped with the Docker image.

13. Once the everything is complete, click **Export** to export a ZIP file with the following directory structure.

    ```
    .
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── configurations.yaml
    └── siddhi-files
        ├── <SIDDHI_FILE>.siddhi
        ├── ...
        └── <SIDDHI_FILE>.siddhi
    ```

    For more information on Siddhi Docker artifacts, see [Siddhi 5.1 as a Docker Microservice](https://siddhi.io/en/v5.1/docs/siddhi-as-a-docker-microservice/).

    !!! info
        This functionality differs based on the web browser you are using and its settings. e.g., if you have set a default
        download location and disabled the **Ask where to save each file before downloading** feature as shown below, the
        file is downloaded to the default location without prompting you for any further input.<br/>

## Exporting Siddhi Applications for Kubernetes

To export one or more Siddhi applications for Kubernetes, follow the procedure below:

1. Start the Streaming Integrator Tooling by issuing one of the following commands from the `<SI_HOME>/bin` directory.

    - For Windows: `tooling.bat`

    - For Linux: `./tooling.sh`

    The Streaming Integrator Tooling opens as shown below.

2. Create the required Siddhi files. The rest of the documentation assumes that you have one or more Siddhi applications to be exported as a Kubernetes artifact. For more information, see [Creating a Siddhi Application](creating-a-Siddhi-Application.md).

3. Click **Export** menu option and then click **For Kubernetes**.

    As a result, the following wizard opens.

4. In **Step 1: Select Siddhi Apps**, select one or more Siddhi applications to be included in the Kubernetes artifact.

5. Click **Next**.

6. In **Step 2: Template Siddhi Apps**, template the Siddhi application if required. You can define a template within the Siddhi application via the `${...}` pattern. In the following example,  `${http.port}`) is added as a template within the source configuration.

    ```
    @source(type='http', receiver.url='http://localhost:${http.port}/${http.context}',
        @map(type = 'json'))
    define stream StockQuoteStream(symbol string, price double, volume int);
    ```

7. Once the templates are defined, click **Next**.

8. In **Step 3: Update Streaming Integrator configurations**, update the `deployment.yaml` file of the Streaming Integrator to enter configurations specific for the Kubernetes artifact. Similar to the previous step, you can template the configurations as well. Use the similar notation (i.e., `${...}`) to specify a template within the configuration file.

11. Once the template values are set, click **Next**.

12. In **Step 5: Bundle additional dependencies**, select the additional JARs to be shipped with the Docker image.

13. Once the JARs are selected, click **Next**.

14. In **Step 7: Add Kubernetes config**, click **Export**. This downloads the ZIP file with the following directory structure.

    ```
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── configurations.yaml
    ├── siddhi-files
    │   ├── <SIDDHI_FILE>.siddhi
    │   ├── ...
    │   └── <SIDDHI_FILE>.siddhi
    └── siddhi-process.yaml
    ```

15. Once the ZIP is downloaded, you can extract and open the `<ZIP_HOME>/siddhi-process.yaml` via a text editor to modify the SiddhiProcess configuration.

    For more information on **SiddhiProcess** Kubernetes configuration, see [Siddhi 5.1 as a Kubernetes Microservice](https://siddhi.io/en/v5.1/docs/siddhi-as-a-docker-microservice/) documentation.
